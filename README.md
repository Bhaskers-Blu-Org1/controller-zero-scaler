## repo-template
The purpose of this project is to provide  a template for new open source repositories.

This repository contains some example best practices for open source repositories, including LICENSE file, boilerplate [README.md](README.md),  [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), and [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) files. These may be copied into a new or existing project to make it easier for developers not on a project team to collaborate.
